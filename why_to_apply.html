                        <p>Being insured ensures that the treatment required will be taken ahead on time to the enlisted medical institutions. Whereas, inthe absence of insurance, there could be a delay in findingthe right place for treatment in right time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Preventive Check-ups</h3>
                        <p>Insurance acts as a stimulator to get various health check-ups done at regular intervals. This helps you identify problems before they turn into a serious medical condition.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assurance</h3>
                        <p>The confirmation, that the expenses/expenditures for your hospitalization or treatment will be taken care of easily, allows you to recover in a better frame of mind rather than worrying about the funding of treatment.</p>
